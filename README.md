# Bulk Image Downloader

This GUI allows you to download multiple images at the same time. It works by downloading the images provided by the user in the form of a text file.

The user has to provide a text file to the GUI having the following format:-<br>
<b><h2>{image-url}|{name of the image}</h2></b>

Ex:-<br>
https://www.fertilome.com/media/klowrey/Article%20Images/Tree.jpg|Tree1<br>
https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/tree_1308-36471.jpg|Tree2

The user can then choose the output folder and the image extension (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) and download all the images.

The user will also be provided a log in the GUI itself. If any of the images is not downloaded, it will display it here.
